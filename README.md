1. Define HTML structure:
    - Create a header section containing a logo, navigation links, and a call to action (CTA) button.
    - Design a carousel section to display product images with dynamic text overlay.

2. Implement CSS styling:
    - Style the header section with appropriate colors, fonts, and layout to enhance branding.
    - Apply CSS rules for the carousel section to ensure proper dimensions, transitions, and overlays.
    - Make the design responsive for different screen sizes and devices.

3. Develop JavaScript functionality:
    - Prepare a JSON object to store dynamic data for the carousel:
        - Text
        - Price
        - Product Image
        - Ambient Color
    - Utilize the JSON data to dynamically populate the carousel section.
    - Implement smooth scrolling transitions for navigating between product images.
    - Synchronize ambient color changes with the scrolling of the product images for visual appeal.

4. Create HTML structure:
    - Build the header section with the logo, navigation links, and CTA button.
    - Set up the carousel section with placeholders for product images and dynamic text overlays.

5. Apply CSS styles:
    - Define styles for the header elements, ensuring a cohesive visual appearance.
    - Customize the carousel section to achieve the desired design and functionality.

6. Add JavaScript functionality:
    - Load the JSON data and use it to populate the carousel with dynamic content.
    - Implement event listeners to handle smooth transitions between carousel slides.
    - Create functions to synchronize ambient color changes based on the current product image.

7. Test the website:
    - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the first fold is fully functional and responsive.
    - Verify that the header, carousel, and ambient color changes work as expected across different devices and screen sizes.

8. Refine and optimize:
    - Fine-tune the design, layout, and functionality based on user feedback and testing results.
    - Optimize code and assets for performance and loading speed.

9. Deploy the first fold of the website:
    - Upload the finalized files to a web server or hosting platform.
    - Perform a final round of testing to ensure everything is working correctly in a live environment.
